Machine learning generally makes the system learn without being explicitly programmed.
ML is great for complex problems from the traditional approach, getting insights of complex problems etc.
ML uses training sets to learn and training instance contained in training set given.
Types of ML systems.
-supervised, -unsupervised, -semisupervised and -Reinforcement learning
Supervised learning tasks include -classification and
-predictors.
Unsupervised learning tasks include -anomaly detection, -dimensionality reduction and -association rule learning.
Supervised learning algorithm are: -k-Nearest Neighbours
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
-Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests -Neural networks
Unsupervised learning algorithm are:
• Clustering inludes: k-Means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and (HCA) Expectation Maximization.  
• Visualization and dimensionality reduction include:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
• Association rule learning include: Apriori and Eclat
Semisupervised learning usually has lots of unlabelled data and a little bit of labelled data.
Reinforcement learning.
-This learns by itself and determine the best strategy. Also the learning system observe the environment then select and perform actions,then get rewards in returns.eg robots.
Batch learning. Systems are incapable of learning incrementally. It must be trained. Also applies what it has learned.
Online learning. You train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially either individually or by small groups.
Challenges for online learning systems is that if you feed big data, systems performance will decline.
Main approaches to generalizations are instance based and model based learning.
Instance based learning. The system learns the examples by heart then generates to new cases using a similarity measure.
Model based learning. Build a model of these examples then use that model to make predictions.
Main challenges in ML.
-Insuficient qty of training data, overfitting the training data, underfitting the training data,poor quality data and others.
